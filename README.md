## 15. Suggested Learning Path

**Foundations & Prerequisites**

- Networking: start with **CCNA 200-301** or the higher-level overview in **TCP/IP in C**.
- Linux & Shell: pair the repository with **Linux Basics for Hackers** and **Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting** (add these locally if missing).
- Programming: **Python Crash Course** for scripting, then **The C Programming Language** for systems depth.

**Core Offensive & Defensive Skills**

- Web Focus: **Web Hacking 101** → **The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** → **OWASP Testing Guide**.
- Pentesting: **The Basics of Hacking and Penetration Testing** → **The Hacker Playbook 3** → **Metasploit Guide**.

**Specialization Tracks**

- Exploit Dev & Reverse Engineering: **Art of Exploitation** → **Shellcoder's Handbook** → **Practical Reverse Engineering** → **Practical Malware Analysis**.
- Mobile: **Android Hacker's Handbook** → **Mobile Application Hacker's Handbook** → **Android Malware Handbook**.
- Malware Analysis & Defense: **Practical Malware Analysis** → **Antivirus Hacker's Handbook** → **Art of Computer Virus Research and Defense**.
- Network Defense: **Practice of Network Security Monitoring** → **Cybersecurity Playbook** → add log analysis practice sets.

**Advanced & Research**

- Dive into **Advanced Penetration Testing**, **Advanced SQL Injection**, **Black Hat Python**, **Black Hat Bash**, and current research papers once core skills feel comfortable.

## Quick Tips

- Anchor your workflow in **Python** and **Linux basics**; most tooling and labs assume both.
- Use the **OWASP Testing Guide** alongside **The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** when targeting web apps.
- For exploit development, expect to invest serious time into **C**, assembly, and operating system internals.
- Hold off on malware reverse engineering titles until debugging, disassembly, and assembly feel natural.
- Document lab work as you go; these books are dense and repetition cements knowledge.
